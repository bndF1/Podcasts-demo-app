# üß† Understanding Frontend Rendering Types in Angular üöÄ

Rendering is a critical part of frontend development, especially when it comes to creating responsive and performant web applications. Angular's recent advancements have added new approaches to rendering, offering more efficient ways to load and display content. Let's dive into the main types of rendering and how Angular is evolving to meet modern performance needs. üñ•Ô∏è

## üåê Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

**Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** is one of the oldest and most well-known techniques in the rendering world. This approach involves generating the HTML content on the server and delivering it to the browser, which ensures the page is viewable as soon as it arrives. SSR provides significant benefits for search engine optimization (SEO) and allows web crawlers to easily access the content, which boosts discoverability.

However, a challenge with SSR is that even though the page content becomes visible quickly, it lacks interactivity until JavaScript is fully loaded and "hydrates" the page, binding interactive elements to events. This can lead to a delay in how quickly users can interact with the site. Without hydration enabled, SSR applications may re-render the entire DOM, causing a visible UI flicker and negatively impacting performance metrics like Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).

To enable hydration in Angular, you can follow these steps:

```javascript
import {
  bootstrapApplication,
  provideClientHydration,
} from '@angular/platform-browser';
...

bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [provideClientHydration()]
});
```

## üìù Static Site Generation (SSG)

**Static Site Generation (SSG)** takes SSR one step further by pre-rendering pages at build time rather than per request. This means HTML pages are generated once and served as static files, which is extremely fast because it eliminates the need for server-side computations for each user. Angular does not use SSG by default, but frameworks like Next.js adopt this strategy.

SSG is particularly useful for pages where content rarely changes. When data does change, such as in cases where content depends on a database, re-rendering must occur to maintain up-to-date information, which can introduce some latency.

## üî• Angular‚Äôs Evolution: Partial Hydration

Angular 17 introduces a new technique called **Partial Hydration**. Unlike SSR, which hydrates an entire page, **Partial Hydration** focuses on incrementally adding JavaScript only when specific interactions are triggered. This means that parts of the application can become interactive as they are needed, optimizing performance by avoiding unnecessary loading of JavaScript.

Starting from Angular 18, you can also enable **Event Replay** to capture user interactions that occur before hydration completes and replay them once hydration is finished. This feature ensures that users' actions are not lost during the initial hydration process, providing a smoother user experience. Event Replay can be enabled using the `withEventReplay()` function:

```javascript
import {
  provideClientHydration,
  withEventReplay,
} from '@angular/platform-browser';

bootstrapApplication(App, {
  providers: [provideClientHydration(withEventReplay())],
});
```

This feature brings Angular closer to frameworks like Qwik, which popularized the concept of resuming JavaScript execution only when absolutely required. The benefit of Partial Hydration is a significant reduction in the amount of JavaScript initially loaded, leading to faster page loads and a more responsive user experience.

## ‚ö° Angular Universal and the Shift to Partial Rendering

In earlier versions, Angular's solution for SSR was **Angular Universal**, which could be cumbersome and led to double rendering ‚Äî once on the server and again on the client. This created an undesirable flickering effect, resulting in a poor user experience.

With **Angular 17**, the shift towards **Partial Rendering** allows developers to hydrate only the parts of the app that need to be interactive. This keeps the page fast and smooth, with fewer JavaScript re-renders.

Hydration in Angular also imposes certain constraints: the generated DOM structure must be identical between the server and the client to avoid hydration mismatches. Direct DOM manipulations or using `innerHTML` can lead to issues, as Angular cannot resolve unexpected changes during hydration. For components that are not hydration-compatible, developers can use the `ngSkipHydration` attribute to exclude them from the hydration process:

```html
<app-example ngSkipHydration />
```

Alternatively, you can set `ngSkipHydration` as a host binding:

```javascript
@Component({
  ...
  host: {ngSkipHydration: 'true'},
})
class ExampleComponent {}
```

## üìù Key Takeaways

1. **SSR** makes content visible quickly but requires hydration to make it interactive.
2. **SSG** is fast and ideal for mostly static content, but lacks flexibility when content frequently changes.
3. **Partial Hydration** in Angular 17 improves performance by only hydrating interactive elements when needed, optimizing JavaScript usage.
4. **Event Replay** in Angular 18 ensures that user interactions are captured and replayed after hydration, improving the overall user experience.
5. Use the **ngSkipHydration** attribute to skip hydration for components that perform direct DOM manipulation or are incompatible with hydration.

## üéØ Why This Matters for Angular Developers

Angular‚Äôs recent innovations aim to reduce JavaScript complexity while ensuring that pages load quickly and perform efficiently. By adopting **Partial Hydration** and improving SSR, Angular makes it easier for developers to build applications that meet both user expectations and SEO requirements. This new rendering approach is a game-changer, allowing Angular developers to achieve balance between fast loading times and high interactivity.

If you're building or maintaining an Angular app, now is a great time to explore these new rendering techniques. They could significantly improve your app‚Äôs performance and user satisfaction!
